=====================

Incremental Kata to train yourself on TDD and incremental deisign

Introduction
============

Numbers Inc. wants to sell a software that is able to translate numbers from the Arabic Digits format to String. Numbers Inc. wants a quick time to market and can potentially reach all the markets around, so the software will probably change a lot during its lifetime. Be ready. :-)

First requirement
=================
The first market to reach is the Italian market so the software must be able to translate the first 20 numbers in Italian, starting from 0 to 19.
So 0 will be translated as "zero" and 1 should be translated as "uno" and so on up to 19 which will be translated as "diciannove".
If you are not Italian you can find some infomation on Italian numbers [here](http://it.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendice:Tutti_i_numeri_in_lettere)
